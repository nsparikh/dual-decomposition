'''
Minimizes the energy in the pairwise graph.
Takes inputs:
	- vector containing number of possible states for each node
	- vector theta_p, which is real-valued and has length n (where n
	  is the sum of the number of possible states per node. This vector
	  contains all the unary potential function values
	- sparse matrix theta_pq, which is real-valued and size nxn. This
	  matrix contains all the pairwise potential function values
'''
def solver(num_possible_states, theta_p, theta_pq):
	pass

'''
Runs the solver by generating a random graph with random potentials,
finds the assignment with the lowest possible energy, and prints out
this energy value.
